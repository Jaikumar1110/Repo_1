List of SQL Commands
SELECT
SELECT is probably the most commonly-used SQL statement. You'll use it pretty much every time you query data with SQL. It allows you to define what data you want your query to return.

For example, in the code below, we’re selecting a column called name from a table called customers.

SELECT name
FROM customers;
SELECT *
SELECT used with an asterisk (*) will return all of the columns in the table we're querying.

SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT only returns data that is distinct — in other words, if there are duplicate records, it will return only one copy of each.

The code below would return only rows with a unique name from the customers table.

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM customers;
SELECT INTO
SELECT INTO copies the specified data from one table into another.

SELECT * INTO customers
FROM customers_backup;
SELECT TOP
SELECT TOP only returns the top x number or percent from a table.

The code below would return the top 50 results from the customers table:

SELECT TOP 50 * FROM customers;
The code below would return the top 50 percent of the customers table:

SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM customers;
AS
AS renames a column or table with an alias that we can choose. For example, in the code below, we’re renaming the name column as first_name:

SELECT name AS first_name
FROM customers;
FROM
FROM specifies the table we're pulling our data from:

SELECT name
FROM customers;
WHERE
WHERE filters your query to only return results that match a set condition. We can use this together with conditional operators like =, >, <, >=, <=, etc.

SELECT name
FROM customers
WHERE name = ‘Bob’;
AND
AND combines two or more conditions in a single query. All of the conditions must be met for the result to be returned.

SELECT name
FROM customers
WHERE name = ‘Bob’ AND age = 55;
